          <li><strong>1906</strong> - The South African colonial government enacts the “Asian Population Registration
            Act” where all residents of Asian countries, including India, had to register their name, age, address,
            job,
            and other personal information and carry a card with their finger prints. Gandhi develops his principals of
            non-violent protest “satyagraha” (devotion to the truth or “soul force”).</li>
          <li><strong>1908</strong> - Gandhi and 2,000 fellow Indians in Johannesburg burn their registration cards in
            protest. Even as Gandhi and other leaders are repeatedly arrested over 6 years of protest, non-violent
            rallies continue to grow in size.</li>
          <li><strong>1920</strong> - Gandhi gets people to more intently boycott British products and encourages
            people
            to start making their own clothes rather than buying British clothing.</li>
          <li><strong>1930</strong> - The British retaliate by passing the Salt Act which makes it illegal for Indians
            to
            make their own salt, punishable by at least three years in jail. On March 12th, Gandhi (now 61 years old)
            travels 320 km (200 miles) on foot for 24 days to Dandi to make his own salt. Others follow. Gandhi is
            again
            imprisoned.</li>
          <li><strong>1942</strong> - Gandhi launches the Quit India campaign declaring India’s independence from
            British
            rule. Gandhi is imprisoned.</li>
          <li><strong>1943</strong> - The 73 year old Gandhi starts a hunger strike that lasts for 21 days.</li>
          <li><strong>1944</strong> - Fearful that Gandhi would die in prison due to failing health and become a
            martyr,
            he and other leaders are released.</li>
          <li><strong>1948</strong> - Gandhi is killed by a member of a Hindu organization angered by Gandhi’s
            peacemaking efforts. Gandhi was shot on his way to evening prayers. His memory and teachings live on in the
            non-violent peace movements of today.</li>
